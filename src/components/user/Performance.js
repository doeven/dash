              For calculation purposes, the company has introduced the Partner Performance Index (PPI), which directly
              affects the individual amount of commission retained by the example platform from the investor. By
              default, this factor is 0.9, i.e. the company holds a commission of 10% from the investor with this
              factor. This factor means that all income received under the investment and partner program is multiplied
              by 0.9.
